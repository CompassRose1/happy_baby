Happy Baby

In this game, your goal will be to care for a baby and make the baby as happy as possible.
The baby's happiness level will be based on its diaper status, hunger, energy, and amusement.
You will have 10 rounds to care for the baby.
The baby's diaper will become dirty every three rounds (even if you just changed it), and its other attibutes will gradually decrease over time.
If at any point, the baby's hunger, energy, or amusement levels reach zero, the game will end and you will lose. Good luck!
